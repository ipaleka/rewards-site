[![build-status](https://github.com/asastats/rewards-site/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/asastats/rewards-site/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![docs](https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/rewards-site/badge/?version=latest)](https://rewards-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/asastats/rewards-site/graph/badge.svg?token=DQC4SRY8J9)](https://codecov.io/gh/asastats/rewards-site)  

A website dedicated to ASA Stats contributions. Previously written in Laravel, now powered by Django.

## Usage

It provides a preview for all historic and latest contributions, hot tasks, contributions guide and more. Community members can use our [Discord Bot](url) to suggest rewards for contributions which appear on this website.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order for the bot to access all the channels in the ASA Stats Discord, an admin has to assign it the `Verified` role.

### Environment variables

Environment variables shouldn't reside in repository, so `.env` file with the following content has to be created in the `rewards-site/rewardsweb` directory:

```
SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
DATABASE_NAME=rewards_db
DATABASE_USER=rewards_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=mypassword
INITIAL_SUPERUSERS=username1,username2
INITIAL_SUPERUSER_ADDRESSES=SUPERUSER1ADDRESS,SUPERUSER2ADDRESS
INITIAL_SUPERUSER_PASSWORDS=password1,password2
```
