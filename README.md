A website dedicated to ASA Stats contributions. Previously written in Laravel, now powered by Django.

## Usage

It provides a preview for all historic and latest contributions, hot tasks, contributions guide and more. Community members can use our [Discord Bot](https://github.com/asastats/rewards-site/tree/main/rewardsweb/rewardsbot) to suggest rewards for contributions which appear on this website.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order for the bot to access all the channels in the ASA Stats Discord, an admin has to assign it the `Verified` role.

### Environment variables

Environment variables shouldn't reside in repository, so `.env` files has to be created based on `.env-example`:

- Website's variables are placed in `rewardsweb/.env`.
- Discord bot's variables are placed in `rewardsweb/rewardsbot/.env`.
- Rewards smart contract's variables are placed in `rewardsweb/rewards/.env`.
- Please check `deploy/.env-example` for deployment variables.

> [!NOTE]
> If ADMIN_*_MNEMONIC variable is not set in `rewardsweb/rewards/.env`, then the system will treat the logged-in superuser as the admin. You will then need to assign the admin's public address to that superuser.
